## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

This project addresses the following functionalities:

### Exercise 1: Alphabetical Directory Listing

Create a class that **alphabetically lists the contents of a directory** received as a parameter.

### Exercise 2: Recursive Directory Tree Listing

Extend the previous class to **recursively list a directory tree** across all its levels. The output must be alphabetized within each level and indicate if the entry is a **Directory (D)** or a **File (F)**, along with its **last modification date**.

### Exercise 3: Saving Output to TXT File

Modify the previous exercise to **save the directory tree listing result to a TXT file** instead of displaying it on the console.

### Exercise 4: Reading and Displaying TXT Content

Add the functionality to **read any TXT file** and display its content in the console.

### Exercise 5: Object Serialization and Deserialization

The program must **serialize a Java Object** to a `.ser` file and subsequently **deserialize** it back into an object.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rafadicandia/Tasca-S1.05.-Java-Utils_Nivell1.git
    ```

2.  **IDE Configuration:**

    Open the folder as a **Maven project** in your IDE. The IDE will process the `pom.xml` file.

3.  **Build the Project:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean compile
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

### üöÄ Running Individual Exercises (Command Line - Maven)

Since each exercise likely has its own main class, you will use the `exec:java` plugin, specifying the main class and any necessary arguments (like the directory path). **Refer to the specific `README.txt` inside each exercise folder for exact class names and required arguments.**

**General Command Structure:**

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="<MainClassName>" -Dexec.args="<arg1> <arg2>..."
```

**Example (Running Exercise 1):**

Assuming the main class is `DirectoryLister` and it takes a path argument:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="DirectoryLister" -Dexec.args="/path/to/directory"
```

### üíª Execute from the IDE

- Open the main file for the specific exercise you wish to run.
- Right-click within the file and select "Run 'MainClassName'". *Note: You may need to configure run arguments within the IDE for exercises that require directory or file paths.*
